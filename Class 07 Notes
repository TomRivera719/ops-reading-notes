 # ***OS Upgrade and Remote Access***


**What is the difference between Bash and PowerShell?**
    *The main differece to begin with is the OS that you would find each respective CLI type program...PowerShell is more rooted in the Windows world whereas Bash is found in Linux or Unix OSs.  The other major difference is how they go about doing things Bash is going to be more command line sytax driven while Powershell is going to be more object-oriented.*

**In what scenarios or environments can you use PowerShell? Name some major platforms where PowerShell is supported.**
   *So seeing as Powershell is Windows based I would say 3 recent major platforms with powershell would be Windows Server, Windows 11 and Powershell Core with the difference in the last being that it is cross platform meaning you can with this utilize Powershell with a MacOs computer or with one of many Linux OSs.*

**List at least three reasons why learning PowerShell could be beneficial for your career and environment.**
   *Well seeing as it is Microsoft based and Microsoft has the biggest marketshare it would be silly to not place priority on learning PowerShell, 2 as stated by many scripts are the easiest way to automate your task and save time as an IT professional and 3rd would be remote management such as troubleshooting and installing software on a customer or client's computer or running tasks for a server as well.*

**How can PowerShellâ€™s automation capabilities improve efficiency and reduce manual errors?**
   *This is pretty straight forward when you produce a script then 1 this automates the process and therefore makes you more efficent as you can hit the most systems in the least amount of time and 2 it reduces errors because you are applying the same script everytime so rather than people like me mispelling something silly and causing an issue goes away as once you test your script then you know that you can apply said script repeatedly with 100% accuracy*

**Think about a situation where you might use PowerShell in your everyday life or job. How could PowerShell help you accomplish a specific task or solve a problem?**
   *So if I was out of town and my mother needed help with something computer related rather than walking her through a technical issue and using terms I know she won't understand I can instead write a script that could execute all the actions required and save her and myself a whole lot of frustration.*
