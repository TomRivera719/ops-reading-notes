# Class 04 Notes


- **What should you do if multiple issues are happening simultaneously during troubleshooting?**
    - *Personally I would do a "Triage" just like a medic on the battle field determine the worst that needs to be addressed and order by priority* 

- **What should be done once a successful solution has been identified during the troubleshooting process?**
    - *The best thing to do is to always make sure to document this so that 1 you can show what was done but also so that you have the fix for the future*

- **What are the benefits of documenting the entire troubleshooting process in a knowledge base?**
    - *As stated above then you have the ability to show the customer what was done and what they paid for and also to be used for the future*

- **Think about a technological device particularly popular in your culture or community.**
    - *iPhone*

- **Imagine a scenario where issues arise: how would you apply CompTIA A+ troubleshooting methodology to help, while considering the end-userâ€™s cultural background?**
    - *Luckily in this case it may be easier than most as this device like all apple devices run on proprietary hardware and software whith this established I would search known issues as this would be my first source to ensure it isnt just an easy fix, if that was ruled out and the iOS was up to date and APPs were also then I would move on to the hardware which again would be well documented due to Apple's specs and then determine the cost to replace and inform the customer of the cost of the repair and show documentation for all steps.
