What is the BIOS?
  In my own words the BIOS is a set of instructions for you computer to follow before it boots up the harddrive or other attached media.

Use analogies from your previous background to explain what happens during the booting process?
  The booting process is much like starting up a car the battery powers the altenator and starter these engage other components in a specific order and timing just as a PC if anything is off it causes issues.

What is the “Power On Self Test”?
  This is a test that a computer does prior to operation this is similar to what we do before we walk out of the door..keys..phone..wallet..glasses etc. once all is good then time to start the day.


What is the CMOS?
  The CMOS is a location on the motherboard that stores a small amount of certain information such as the time and date and admin password so that even when you power down the PC this information is still there and stored.

What is the CMOS battery?
  The CMOS battery is what allows the small amount of data on motherboard refered to as CMOS to be stored when the PC is powered down.
