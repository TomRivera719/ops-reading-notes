China's Spy Chip

How is a hardware hack different than a software hack?
  With a hardware hack you have an internal device implanted vs having to remote into the software side of the interface of the computer.

What are the two ways for spies to alter a computerâ€™s hardware?
  Implant devices when manufactured or you could "repair" a device and install a device.

Explain how the hack worked.
  By having a hardware device such as a chip you would not have to work to bypass the normal security measures and in addition will not set off the normal concerns.

How were investigators able to trace the chips back to the source?
  Every device has a signature and when monitored if data is being forwarded then that data also will leave a path of origin.
