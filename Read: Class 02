Which is better in a CPU, more cores or higher speed? Under which circumstances is that true? How many CPU cores does a computer need?
  It is a matter of preference as muti cores may process multi tasks better while a faster core may be faster, generally speaking 2-4 is needed with the current uses and programs...we arent playing Oregon trail anymore.

What details are you looking for when finding a motherboard which fits your processor?
  I would be looking to ensure that it is compatible with the hardware that I want to utilize in my build.

What are the tradeoffs you’d evaluate while selecting a storage device?
  The main trade off is performance vs price because a SSD will perform better than a disk but at a premium price.

Think about others with a background similar to yours. How would you explain to them the key parts of a computer, in a way they’d best connect with?
  CPU is the brain, RAM- Memories of things you don't care about... gone quickly, ROM- Core memories and training
