What is an ISO File?
  I believe it stands for Image Source Optical.. this was originally a file on a disk for the optical drive to read 
but this is generally used to describe images usually an operating system and utilized for install on a bootable drive 
or for use in a virtualization such as to run an operating system like OSX on a Windows PC of Linux machine.

How do you write an ISO file to a CD, DVD, or removable media (like a thumb drive)?
  In order to write the file as any disk you would utilize the software that corresponds to the hardware that you plan 
to use so for CDRs or DVDRs this may be the same utility but for removable media such as a thumb drive you can use the default 
writing program or a third party program such as RUFUS that simplifies the process.  In either case you would aquire or create the 
image you wish to transpose to whatever media form you choose then commit to the transfer given the peramiters you require and transfer 
the image.   
How do you create an ISO file?
  You can use a multitude of programs to make an ISO this could even be an image of a home movie tnat you wish to but onto DVD or an OS
and even a program that you created yourself but as stated above you would set the perameters you require and "burn" the image to whichever 
media form you choose.

How do you mount an ISO file?
  If the ISO is on disk you generally install instructional files so that it will autorun and if it does not you can point to the disk drive and
either double click or right click and select "mount".  If the image is on a USB you have the choice of making this drive bootable such as in the case 
of an operating system or you can utilize a 3rd party program or native software to right-click and select "mount" most 3rd party apps will be those 
that also do archiving and packiong/unpacking of zip files.
